# Coral
This is the code repository for the federated query optimization paper titled *'Coral: Federated Query Join Order Optimization Based on Deep Reinforcement Learning'*.

This project is built on the dynamic data management framework [Calcite](https://calcite.apache.org/). We implement the federated query system Coral on top of Calcite.

The detailed setup and running methods are the same as an Java application.
